INFO: [Place 46-3] During incremental compilation, routing data from the original checkpoint is applied during place_design. As a result, dangling route segments and route conflicts may appear in the post place_design implementation due to changes between the original and incremental netlists. These routes can be ignored as they will be subsequently resolved by route_design. This issue will be cleaned up automatically in place_design in a future software release.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mig_7series_0_inst/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mig_7series_0_inst/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mig_7series_0_inst/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
